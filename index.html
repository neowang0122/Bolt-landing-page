    <h1>Privacy Policy for Bolt ‚Äì AI Copilot for Mail</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Bolt ‚Äì AI Copilot for Mail (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our macOS application, Bolt ‚Äì AI Copilot for Mail (the ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù).</p>
    <p>By using the Application, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the Application.</p>
    <p>Bolt is designed to enhance your email experience by providing AI-assisted features. To enable this, it may interact with your email content locally on your device, without transmitting it externally.</p>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Bolt is built with privacy in mind. It processes all email content locally on your device, and we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</p>

    <h3>a. Personal Data You Voluntarily Provide</h3>
    <p>We do not actively collect personal information. If you voluntarily contact us for support or feedback (e.g., via email), we may receive information such as your name or email address. This data will only be used to respond to your inquiry.</p>

    <h3>b. Email Content Processing</h3>
    <p>To enable its AI copilot functionality, the Application accesses the content of emails you are composing or viewing. This processing occurs entirely on your device using Apple‚Äôs native APIs. No email content is ever transmitted to external servers or stored outside your system.</p>

    <h3>c. In-App Purchase Information</h3>
    <p>If you choose to purchase a subscription, all transactions are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not access or store any billing or credit card information. We only receive anonymized purchase confirmation data (e.g., subscription status and transaction history), which is used solely to enable or restrict access to premium features within the Application.</p>

    <h3>d. No Analytics or Crash Reporting</h3>
    <p>We do not use any analytics, tracking, or crash reporting tools that transmit data off your device.</p>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data beyond voluntary support inquiries, our use of information is minimal and strictly functional:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Processing:</strong> To provide AI features, your email content is analyzed locally. No content is shared with us or any third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> Purchase information from Apple is used only to verify subscription status and manage access to paid features.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Communication:</strong> If you contact us, we use the provided information exclusively to respond to your request.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data. As we do not collect user data through the Application, the scenarios in which information might be disclosed are extremely limited:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose limited support communication records if required by law, court order, or to comply with legal processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfer:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, any information you voluntarily provided for support may be transferred. You will be notified of any material changes via a notice within the Application or on our website.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your email content is never shared, as it remains entirely on your device.</p>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect any limited personal information you may voluntarily provide (e.g., via email support). All core features of the Application operate locally, minimizing risk by design.</p>
    <p>Please note that while we follow industry best practices, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We encourage users to practice safe computing habits.</p>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <h2>6. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected information from a child, we will take steps to delete it promptly.</p>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect or process personal data from users, most data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) do not directly apply. However, if you have questions about your rights or wish to make a request, you may still contact us.</p>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date above and post the new version here. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

    <hr class="custom-rule" />

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, you can reach us at:<br />
